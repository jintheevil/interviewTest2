# Book Keeping Application

Hi guys, this is a very simple book keeping application made for test purposes but feel free to download it and play around with it.
It uses Ionic Framework as a front-end and Firebase as a database.

It includes functions such as "Add Books", "Edit Books" "Archive Books", and "See Archive".
I'm open for criticism as long as it's constructive.

Enjoy!
